The Ulimate System will look different for everyone, but here is an outline of what you need to consider when making yours as I overview mine.
<!--more-->

## Hardware

Not all hardware is created equal. While I could buy more powerful parts this was one of the most powerful systems I could build with my requirements. Here is all my requirements for Hardware and a link to my final system build.

- Low Audio Footprint (No higher than 30dB)
- 2 GPU capable (Gaming and AV Work capable in multiple operating systems at the same time)
- Large amount of FULL cores. (No efficiency cores that have lower VM performance.)
- Large amount of Memory for Virtual Machines
- Expandable with Large amount of PCIe Ports (6+ Ports with at least 2 16x slots)
- High-end motherboard (Helps avoid IOMMU Group errors)

These requirements are to avoid past issues I've had with systems. It is not about getting the highest number, but about avoiding problems you've encountered in the past.

### My Specifications
