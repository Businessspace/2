## Playstation is #1

Playstation has the largest market share in the gaming space. It's main operating system is based on FreeBSD and is often toted as a good thing in the open source circles. By comparison, Microsoft's Xbox is completely closed and uses it's own DirectX 12 to perform most of the gaming in the console. What if I told you... They are really the same!

Sony Playstation has undoubtedly carved its name as a prominent player in the gaming industry, boasting impressive hardware capabilities, a diverse library of games, and a passionate fanbase. While the Playstation offers an immersive gaming experience, it is important to acknowledge its limitations when it comes to fostering open-source development. This article aims to shed light on why Sony Playstation is not conducive to open-source initiatives and explore the implications of its closed ecosystem.

## The Problems

- Proprietary Software and Restrictions:
One of the key barriers to open-source development on Sony Playstation is the prevalence of proprietary software. The platform operates on a closed ecosystem, tightly controlling the software and limiting access for developers. Unlike open platforms that encourage collaboration and community-driven innovation, Playstation's closed nature inhibits the free flow of ideas and hampers the development of open-source projects.

- Limited Modding Capabilities:
Modding, a vibrant aspect of open-source culture, enables users to modify and enhance games, fostering creativity and extending the lifespan of titles. Unfortunately, Sony Playstation imposes significant restrictions on modding activities. The company's strict policies and proprietary security measures create obstacles for developers looking to tinker with game code or create custom modifications, stifling the potential for community-driven open-source projects.

- Lack of Official Support for Linux:
Linux has long been celebrated for its open-source philosophy and its compatibility with a wide range of devices. However, Sony Playstation lacks official support for Linux operating systems. This absence hinders developers who prefer open-source platforms and limits their ability to explore the potential of Playstation hardware beyond its intended gaming capabilities.

- Limited Homebrew Scene:
Homebrew development has played a vital role in fostering open-source communities and nurturing innovation in the gaming world. Unfortunately, Sony Playstation's closed ecosystem restricts the growth of a thriving homebrew scene. While some homebrew projects exist, they often face significant obstacles due to restrictive policies and security measures enforced by Sony.

- Legal Constraints and Intellectual Property:
Sony's stringent protection of intellectual property rights can be a significant deterrent for open-source enthusiasts. The company's policies and licensing agreements restrict the distribution and modification of proprietary software and game assets. This poses legal challenges and creates a less welcoming environment for open-source developers who thrive on the ability to freely use, modify, and distribute software.

## What about FreeBSD?

Since Playstation is based on FreeBSD, you would think there is a lot of collaboration back and forth between the two. While the project has made some commits and contributions, it is limited and most of the benefits revolve around bug fixes and exposure. BSD in general is used by other for-profit companies as well, but their networking stack is generally considered better than the Linux one. Netgate, makers of pfSense, Whatsapp, and even a small portion of Netflix's backend utilizes a bit of BSD. 

Sony picked FreeBSD over Linux because of the license behind FreeBSD that allows them to take the project and close source any contributions then profit from the proprietary nature of the platform. They are not obligated in anyway to contribute to the project.

If they picked Linux this would not be the case. Linux operates under a strict GPL license that requires projects that are based on it to remain open source to contribute back to the main branch. So everyone can reap the rewards as a collective. One example of problems that arise from Linux's GPL license is ZFS, arguably the best file system, is actually owned by Sun (Oracle subsidiary) using a CDDL license and it makes compatibility with Linux's GPL difficult and why iXsystems (TrueNAS) choose FreeBSD as their main distribution.
