Linux Laptops are a niche market, but often misunderstood as there are only 3 acceptable Linux Laptops I would daily drive. System76, Kfocus, and Tuxedo. Let me explain why.
<!--more-->

## Why just 3 manufacturers?

There are plenty of manufacturers that sell laptops with Linux pre-installed, but only 3 that I would recommend. The reason is simple, these 3 manufacturers have the best support for Linux, the best hardware compatibility, and have regression testing on updates.

What about Dell, HP, Lenovo, and others? They are great manufacturers, but they are not Linux manufacturers. They do not have the same level of support for Linux as System76, Kfocus, and Tuxedo. They do not have the same level of hardware compatibility, and they do not have ANY regression testing on updates.

Simply put, They control the linux updates so the hardware always performs well. They have the best support for Linux, and they have the best hardware compatibility.
