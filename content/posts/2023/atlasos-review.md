I don't review Custom ISO or Custom Windows. Anything that requires downloading ISO is an immediate red flag. AtlasOS takes a different approach using official Microsoft ISOs and modifying them using an open source tool.

## What is it?

A stripped version of windows that has had a LOT of Microsoft's tools and bloat removed. It is NOT to be used lightly or by an uneducated or non-tech savvy person! However, in the right hands it can be a good tool when you have a specific need, but I would NOT daily drive it.
