Over the past 3 years I've setup a hosted solution for a business that has saved them over $5000 per year on their telephone bill.
<!--more-->

If you have ever dealt with porting numbers or switching telephone services it is a complete nightmare. However, you can do this all yourself and take control and save a TON of money in the process. Need to move from this solution? Install and register your numbers on something else in minutes, NOT days or even weeks in some instances.

The best part is you will own your numbers directly and have NO contracts that some sneaky companies that lock you in to their services for years at a time.

## The Solution

There are many solutions that can be self hosted where you register a telephony trunk, but the easiest I've found is 3CX. It has a variety of plans from free to under 10 users to a good small business setup for around 20 users, but the best part is you pay for the SERVER... NOT the user accounts.

## Installation

I've done videos on 3cx installation. Here are links to both self-hosted and using the hosted plans above. For a small business I'd recommend the SMB Plan above.
