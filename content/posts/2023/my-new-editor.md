After years of switching IDE's and editors, then trying dozens of vim configurations... I HAVE FOUND THE PERFECT EDITOR! My Neovim configuration I have tweaked to perfection.

I'm not a god programmer the likes of the primeagen, but a mere mortal that has taken the time to finally come to a spot that makes my configuration the perfect one for me and possibly you.

## Neovim Problems

I've done several iterations of setting up neovim from scratch, to using neovim distros like lazyvim, nvchad, and lunarvim. These "distros" just customize too much for my liking. 

Starting from scratch is rough, because of all the options and customization that needs to be done. This is why people end up using vscode because it just works. However, there is a better way!
