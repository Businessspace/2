## Why UrBackup

This program is absolutely amazing and free! All it's source code is on the internet which made it able to adapt to ALL operating systems. Windows, Mac, Linux... hell it even has ARM support!

## Universal Backup Servers

There is a ton of different supported servers and even some that are unsupported that still work. Here is the official download page: <http://www.urbackup.org/download.html>

One notable non-official project is for Synology NAS devices. I use a 64-bit Synology on DSM 7+, so pay attention to your current version if you want to use the project below.
