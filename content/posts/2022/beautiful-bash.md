## Requirements

With all my guides I like to create bash scripts that will auto install and configure everything. You may have heard of the starship prompt, which this uses, but is heavily themed. I also have my included bashrc with a ton of useful aliases.

The setup file will also install autojump which helps you navigate between directories.
