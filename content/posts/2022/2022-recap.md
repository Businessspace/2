Recap of 2022.
<!--more-->

## The 2022 Goals

- [x] Live Streams expanded
- [x] More Virtualization Videos
- [x] More GitHub Projects (Over 500+ Contributions)
- [ ] Custom Debian Build (Debian-Titus)

The Live streams experiment were a failure. I've ramped up my virtualization content, but find a lot of it go over peoples heads. For GitHub contributions, I started to find my groove about midway through the year, and make substantive progress on projects.
